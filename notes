1. Have some partial savings when training the quantum model.

2. Less training time, couple of seconds to a minute. See what works individually, then combination

3. Start with larger sets, train on subset, increase training time. See how increasing training time improves the model.

4. Search for benchmarks, ask the llms for this task. 

5. Using the benchmarks, use similar models. Then use quantum models.

6. Start qubits low[<0;131;1M, then increase qubits near the end.

7. Exploration phase: put low qubits, low features, small models

8. Explotation phase: Ramp it up gradually

9. Look at Wu's Horatio's, and Sean's repos.

10.
